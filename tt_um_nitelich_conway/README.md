# Tiny Tapeout Conway's Game of Life

[Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md).

This project was tested locally using Icarus Verilog. A quick ["local compile test"](src/local_compile_test.bat) script is given in the source directory. However, the full development test benches, scripts, and MiSTer RBF files are not made available as part of this repository. The Tiny Tapeout testbenches have not been instrumented beyond the basic suggestions made in [test/README.md](test/README.md).

This project is [open source and free software](LICENSE) under an Apache v2.0 license. Author's Note: The only reason I'm using an Apache v2.0 license is to conform to Tiny Tapeout's terms and conditions. Working in an embedded systems job for years has jaded me horribly to the state of "open source" and "free" software, particularly when hosted on a publicly available and well-known platform like github.
